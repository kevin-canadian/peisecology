This directory contain the different generations of the
peiskernel. The intention of the different generations are to allow
for older softwares to keep working without updates and, sometimes, to
allow for a stable and an unstable release of the kernel. 

Each generation is kept as a separate branch and all modifications
within a given generation should be API compatible (but not binary
compatible), requiring only a recompilation of softwares to work with
an updated PEIS kernel release.

New versions inside a given generation are NOT required to be network
compatible with older version, and softwares linked against the
peiskernel will give a warning message when they note that they are
out of date (this is visisble to them only if they can see the version
number of other components).

- G6: This is the current generation that should be used in RUBICON
- and in all other projects started 2011 and later.

- G5: Development version. Currently only used in PEIS Android
- G4: Only for setups older than 2010
- G3: For archive purposes only. Do not use
