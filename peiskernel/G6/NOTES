Adding structured data _inside_ tuples.
---------------------------------------

This can be done using JSON as a light-way representation. 
Add JSON parsing to the PEIS kernel. 

Advantages: 

Provides richer representation capabilities inside the individual tuples. 

When we add complex search queries this gives this gives better ways of representing them

Hierachy of tuples to be represented as complex JSON data
---------------------------------------------------------

Let a tuple higher up in a hierachy be represented as a JSON objekt that contains all of it's children (plus possible it's own data?)

Advantage:  Now all the advanced queries can be done on the root level to find complex hosts!

Disadvantage: This breaks how tupleview handles images with the "isClickable" etc tuples (maybe??)
