Make some tuples x-peis/boolean


Urgent: adapt the timeout lengths for retransmissions based on average 
time receive them. (This is important for bluetooth!)


Let the routingTable use the connection with fewest currently queued
packages (we need multiple entires in the global routing table for
this... or iterate over each connections routingTable) 

Include number of (actual) connections in the broadcasted information..










* Protocoll imcompatible changes (to be implemented for next major version)

  * KnownHostInfo

      - Fullname should only be component name.

      - New field for PID.

  * Tuples: Add a "flags" field.

      - Semaphore

      - Tuple values are queued in order, triggered when arrived, or
      only care about latest value.

      - Tuples sequence number

* How to reduce bandwidth

  * General

    - Smooth out "spikes" by adding small random variations in service
   periods.

  * Routing bandwidth

    - Split the routing into a separate routing only part (id&seq = 2+2 bytes, send often) and another hostinfo part (send seldom)

    - Keep one routing table from each neighbour. Merge into ones own
   routing table.

    - Routing part, concatenate many pieces of routing information
   (alt. send only to neighbours but complete routing table)

    - Resend routing table at a slow but fixed interval. Do immediate
   changes when new hosts added/removed from routing table.

 * Subscriptions

   - Debug that initial send of subscription  to new all hosts works

   - Much more seldom resending of information (5-10 minutes).

   - Remove subscriptions to hosts 0that have disappeared (am i already
   doing this, christmas checks?)

* Bugs to look for

   - Components/tuples disappearing randomly (caused by missed routing packages?)

* Other

  - Implement "estimated package loss" by looking at sequence numbers
   of incomming packages along each link.

  - (Re)Implement using "pending" connections for TCP connection attemts.

  - Use protocollVersion and networkString also in the UDP broadcasts.

  - unsubscribeIndirectTuple

   - When peisk(mt)_defaultStringTuple is called, if the tuple exists, data in
   the tuple is marked as old -- probably shouldn't be.  The
   peisk(mt)_tupleExists function is the problem.  This function probably
   shouldn't mark data as old, since when one calls it one hasn't looked at the
   data.
