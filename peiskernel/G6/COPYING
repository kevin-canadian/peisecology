Although all of the Ecologies of PEIS project are released under an
OpenSource licence there exists some technical restrictions to
licence different files as GNU LGPL, GNU GPL or GNU FDL depending on
if they are libraries, progamfiles or documentation. Unless otherwise
noted all documentation are released under the GNU FDL. Since all
three of these licencses are GPL compatible this should not pose any
problems for distributiors. 

Since this PEIS-kernel distribution includes both library files, program files
and documentation we have in each file annoted the exact licence under
which it is released. See the files COPYING.GPL, COPYING.LGPL or
COPYING.FDL for each respective licence.
