To install run the following commands:

# To setup the compilation environment etc.
./configure     

# To compile and install the peiskernel 
cd peiskernel
make
# If you have sudo, otherwise get root and do make install
sudo make install 
cd ..

# To compile everything else
make
sudo make install


Note: If you have downloaded this sourcecode directly from the
subversion repositories you may need to run ./autogen.sh before begining.

If you want to generate the documentation for the PEIS-kernel you can
do so by running the command "doxygen" if you have it installed.
