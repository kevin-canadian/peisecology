Tupleview
---------

Used for visualising tuples. For more information see the 
Wiki pages for the EcologiesOfPeisProject or ask Mathias,

Dependencies
------------

To render graphs properly (used eg. in the EcologyView) tupleview
requires the external program "dot" as found in the package
"graphviz". If this program is not install these graphs will just be
empty. 

To render tuples in the EasyTimeline format (eg. as used in Wikipedia)
you need the external program "ploticus" as well as "EasyTimeline.pl"
(the later is included in the tupleview sources and should be
installed automatically under /usr/local/share/tupleview/)

One extra constraint on the EasyTimeline tuples are that they _must_
begin with the characters "# timeline" (remove citation marks).
