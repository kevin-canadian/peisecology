About the generations:

The generation numbers of tupleview should match the generation number of the PEIS kernel that you are currently using. 

- G6: Use this tupleview version for RUBICON and for all other projects started after 2011

- G6-oldgtk: Use this tupleview version only if you are using an older linux installation with GTK 2.20 or earlier. (Examples include Ubuntu 10.04)
