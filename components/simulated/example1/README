This is an example scenario showing how a laser producer, odometry
producer and a SLAM consumer is running. 

launch.sh      # script for starting experiment
configure.ts   # script for setting up the configuration
make-error.ts  # Makes one of the components produce an error
stop.ts        # Shuts down the components

Note that all scripts that ends with .ts should be run through the
PEIS commandline scripting language "tuplescript", if you have
compiled and installed the latest peiskernel with the default prefix,
then it is /usr/local/bin/tuplescript, and the .ts files already
contain the right unix commandline interpreter. Otherwise just do:

tuplescript ./configure.ts
